<b>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?<b/>
I chose to develop a mobile app to help keep track of events for a user. The app needed to have a login screen so multiple users could use the app for their own events. Another screen would be needed where the events then were displayed after logging in. There also needed to be a database where user login info is kept, and a database where event information is kept. There also needed to be a way to add, edit, and delete events. The app serves the putpose to help the user stay organized and be reminded (if SMS permissions were given) of upcoming events.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app I created comprises of 4 screens and several popups. The 2 main screens include the login screen and the main app screen where events are displayed. Another screen is for registering an accoun, and the last one is for adding an event. Popups include if a user forgets their password, they can retrieve it, when updating an event that is already made, and also for enabling or disabling SMS messaging from the app for notifications. I feel my UI was successful and kept users in mind because it is easiet to tap a button than slide, so all my actions are based on button clicks.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
At first I tried to code in the same flow as the app, but It kept making me jump all over the place. Once I stepped back I then was apble to look at the project and split it up into smaller chunks and was able to do it one part at a time. Also, making sure all the UI was in place first and determining what was going to be a screen vs a popup helped determine how things were coded as well.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I was able to come up with test cases based on the requirements. Then I had my wife test the app on the emulator to see if she was able to complete and pass the test cases.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The biggest parts for me was creating the database with SQLite and also connecting the code to the UI elements. This was something that was a bit different for me than what I have done in the past with other coding sowftware in previous classes.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel the login screen with having the feature to register, login, and also retrieve a forgotten password was an area that showed off my knowledge and skills. It also allowed me to use the knowledge and skills of validation for validating user access based on a user name and password.
